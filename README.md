Machine Learning Project: Income Prediction Using Census Data
Cornell Tech - Mansa Patel | Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellow

Objective: Built a machine learning pipeline to predict whether individuals earn above or below $50K annually, leveraging U.S. Census data with over 32,000 samples and 15 features
Data Preparation: Cleaned and imputed missing data, encoded categorical features (e.g., education, occupation), and performed feature scaling for numerical columns to improve model performance


Model Development: Implemented and evaluated multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy


Hyperparameter Optimization: Employed Grid Search and Randomized Search techniques for fine-tuning hyperparameters, leading to a 10% improvement in accuracy and 15% reduction in overfitting
Performance Metrics: Achieved an 93% accuracy, with an F1 score of 0.85, and optimized model precision and recall for high-stakes income predictions


Model Interpretability: Utilized SHAP values and feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of income prediction, such as education level, occupation, and hours worked per week

Result Impact: The model demonstrated robust performance across various demographic segments, providing valuable insights into socioeconomic factors influencing income inequality
